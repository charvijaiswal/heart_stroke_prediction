# heart_stroke_prediction
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with heart stroke being a significant contributor. Early prediction and intervention can save lives and improve patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model using R to identify individuals at risk of heart stroke based on their health data.


The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method is used in this work to predict cardiac attacks.
